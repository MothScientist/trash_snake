# Snake Search
*This project was born from the idea and the need for me (a novice developer) to acquire a pet project and at the same time consolidate / acquire / improve programming skills. This is a desktop application that is written in python (using C++ inserts, which are essentially just to show that I can combine these 2 languages in one project) using the tkinter library, which is made of graphics part (never use tkinter, use PyQt if necessary). The application allows (or will allow in the future) to perform a deep search for files on a Windows computer (by file names, extensions, and also by the information that is inside them), get information about the amount of memory on your computer (as well as graphs using matplotlib) and file conversion (txt -> mp3, pdf -> txt , jpeg -> ico, etc...) The idea of such an application was born from a previously written program that just helping me find a lost file on my computer among a million other files and folders.I would be happy if you give a star to the project to support my endeavours.*
